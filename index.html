<p> <b>What is going on between Gaza and Israel?</b></p>
<p>On Oct. 7, Palestinians from Gaza carried out attacks in Israel that killed at least 1,200 Israelis, injured thousands more, and took an estimated 240 hostages. Israel immediately launched attacks on Gaza. Since then, at least 24,448 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed, 40% of them children. Violence continues to escalate and those numbers continue to grow. 
    <p><b>Why are they fighting?</b></p>
    <p>Key areas of the conflict include the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the status of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements, borders, security and water rights, as well as Palestinian freedom of movement and the Palestinian right of return. 
        - The Israeli/Palestinian conflict has its roots in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the birth of major nationalist movements among the Jews and among the Arabs, both geared towards attaining sovereignty for their people in the Middle East.[39] Early Jewish immigration and settlement was accompanied by the development of colonial relations with the Palestinian population, which included exploitation of the relatively impoverished locals in addition to mutual dependence and racism. The Palestinian fear of displacement and dispossession would gradually be replaced by a broader sense of national expression which included the rejection of the Zionist goal of turning the mostly Arab populated land into a Jewish homeland.[40]

    <p><b>Could this resolve soon?</b></p>
    <p>
    The IDF has assessed that fighting in Gaza will likely last throughout all of 2024, as Israel works to strip Hamas of its military and governing capabilities. The army is also preparing for fighting to escalate further on the Lebanon border, where Hezbollah and allied Palestinian terror groups have carried out daily rocket, missile, and drone attacks, at the same time as the war in Gaza.</p>
